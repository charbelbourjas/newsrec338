Auto complete sucks.  \u201c Love of Country\u201d (not County \ud83d\ude01)\n@MSNBC Well that\u2019s just ignorant. Either he\u2019s ignorant or his translator is. Nationalism and patriotism are one in the same. . . Love of county.\n@wmartin46 @DailyCaller Actually voting for yourself isn\u2019t needed in Broward County.  The people counting the votes and more than helpful in filling in the ballots for you.\n@dalipals_martin @brendaroun @DailyCaller Did you give Justice Kavanaugh that same consideration?\n@MSNBC @TGowdySC oh yeah.\n@CNN So does that mean no more hard labor in prisons or community service? Because republicans outlawed all other forms of slavery over a hundred years ago.\n@PMLaPoint @MSNBC @morningmika They\u2019re not going to do anything now. Just more day time soap opera investigations to nowhere.\n@MSNBC @morningmika And yet again. The \u201cpopular vote\u201d means nothing. Not to mention that many races in California Only had democrats on the ballots.\n@MSNBC @maddow What\u2019s to recuse if the investigation is over and Mueller is drafting his final report? Don\u2019t you guys watch the news that you report?\n@A___G___C @MSNBC @MaddowBlog It\u2019s not easy to \u201cfire\u201d an elected official. But yes, I do agree that this woman should have been removed after a judge found her guilty of destroying ballots in 2016.\n@mgv218 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Actually Broward County is a solid blue.\n@RichardJLaurie1 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Miami has 6 million people and can count their votes legally. Broward has 1.8 million and still isn\u2019t finished \u201cfinding\u201d ballots 4 days later. Google Broward voter fraud and you\u2019ll be shocked to see that they have been found guilty by a judge (destroyed ballots in 2016)\n@RV1026 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog I hate Broward Co for more reasons than just their corruption.\n@PMLaPoint @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Broward County always waits to report their numbers. The panhandle is in central time zone and an hour behind Broward which gives Broward an hour head start but they are always last to report. Miami has 6 million ppl - Broward has 1.8 million and even Miami finishes faster.\n@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Not Florida. . . Broward County. It\u2019s always Broward county.\n@sughill1 @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @RepTedDeutch @ChrisCuomo Not the whole state just Broward County. It\u2019s always Broward County \ud83d\ude21\n@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @RepTedDeutch @ChrisCuomo \u201cNo evidence\u201d? Could it be because Broward won\u2019t let anyone see what they are doing?\n@CNN Trump picked a fight? Didn\u2019t that French Dude talk crap about needing a military to protect Europe from the US. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think Europe paying for their own military is a great idea. I just don\u2019t think Trump threw the first punch here.\n@TheLeadCNN @CNN @KirstenPowers \u201cThis is what republicans do\u201d.  Are you shitting me. Hello. Russia. Are you there ?\n@MSNBC @alivitali Absentee and early votes should be the easiest to count. Crap stinks in Broward (again!)\n@FoxNews Y\u2019all wanna try that last segment again. That woman screwed up every word out of her mouth. She clicked only Broward then spoke about the results for the state. The entire report made no damn sense at all \ud83d\ude44\n@realDonaldTrump Excellent idea. We could save an assload of money if after all these years they would finally pony and provide their own security.\n@Joestv_74501 @benshapiro Broward is still making up those numbers.\n@EmeraldRobinson @OANN @realDonaldTrump \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 savage. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n@DavidLaufmanLaw If Mueller is writing his final report now. Why are you wasting time talking about nothing.\n@MSNBC And we\u2019ll never forgive you and your husband for the damage you did to America. Go away bitxh\n@tremstertradcat @KamalaHarris @RealJamesWoods @jack @Twitter Your tax dollars at work\n@TexasBred323 @KamalaHarris Because the acting AG doesn\u2019t have to be confirmed. Just Sally Yates wasn\u2019t confirmed when she was the acting AG.\n@SusanSolomon @KamalaHarris Mueller is drafting his findings now. The investigation is over. Trump knew that and is why he waited to fire Sessions.\n@RJoySanchez @KamalaHarris They can\u2019t. Because no matter how much @msnbc cries and lies. There is actually nothing illegal about this.\n@KamalaHarris Oh Bullshit. Mueller is drafting his final report now. I know it. You know it and Trump knew it. You\u2019re a pathetic POS and we all know that too.\n@jraproductions @MSNBC Scott is winning and Broward keeps \u201cfinding\u201d Ballots. And refuse to give the updates on the numbers as required by law.\n@MSNBC \u201cPartisan rhetoric attack\u201d? Are you people insane? 1. It\u2019s beyond pathetic that you haven\u2019t been reporting on what\u2019s happening in Broward County (AGAIN!). 2. Why must you always inject your own personal politics into everything you report? #disgraceful\n@MSNBC @BeschlossDC 2 quick points. 1. Y\u2019all protested the hell out of Sessions appointment (calling him a racist,etc). 2. Aren\u2019t you also reporting that Mueller is currently drafting his final report?\n@CNN Keep letting in muslims and wondering why the anti-Semitic acts keep increasing. People aren\u2019t very bright. Muslims openly call for death to Israel and United States but somehow people can\u2019t understand that they really do mean it.\n@joev816 @wernet @MetaAdamJohnson @willsommer Moving forward. I think all other counties in Florida should refuse to release their numbers until after Broward does. Broward always waits to see the  results from the rest of the state to figure how many fake ballots they need to create.\n@marklevinshow Loll. Oh Mark. I gotta give you a \u201cCaptain Obvious\u201d on that tweet. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n@CNN Death in the senate. Hahahaha. But thanks for showing that they were lying out the ass before the elections.\n@RealistRod @TomFitton The FDA says \u201cpotentially less harmful alternative\u201d.  So again. In all fairness. How do we know that E Cigs actually are a \u201csafer product\u201d?  Also. I can\u2019t speak for the UK. But in the US those Bullshit studies are funded by the company trying to sell the product.\n@RealistRod @TomFitton They are relatively new in the US and if you look at traditional cigarettes. It took decades to fully know the dangers.\n@CNN Wouldn\u2019t such challenges be decided in court by a judge\n@TomFitton In all fairness. How do we know it\u2019s a \u201csafer alternative\u201d? It takes years to fully know the long term effects of anything.\n@CNN And now you know how the Dems won the house\n@AdamBaldwin @Acosta Liberal media heads explode over Whimpering Jim but barely eek out a report about the mob that attacked Tucker Carlson\u2019s house last night. Seems to me that one is defiantly more of a threat to the 1st Amend than the other. But as usual the media has them ass backwards\n@MarcACaputo Sooo. You\u2019re saying that Broward voters were too stupid to vote but the rest of the state was able to understand the ballot?\n@wysiwygit @CNN None of the above. It was looped to highlight him pushing her arm away.\n@CNN Misleading video my ass. We\u2019ve seen it from more than one source and were watching it live. You people are pathetic to take a still shot (out of the 3 attempts to collect the mic) to push your lie.  He DID push her arm down and away. F^*k CNN. #FINALSTRAW.\n@TheLeadCNN @CNN @AdamSchiff Adam stiff is a dumbass\n@JJarabak @MSNBC Broward County. It\u2019s ALWAYS Broward.\n@Acosta https://t.co/j4ZhwX7SBw\n@Acosta Fuck off. https://t.co/OOdflGHtFE\n@icedcoffees @JawMadison @Tim_Canova Because it\u2019s Broward County and they are run by democrats. Duh\nBroward County Florida. Imagine that. No chit. Broward is corrupt A F! https://t.co/Keg5OBfZwl\n@andrewbaldy @bdomenech Maybe because we knew that 75% would vote republican (duh). Why do Dems focus on getting people to vote in heavy dem counties? (Duh)\n@bdomenech @benshapiro Yeah well duh.  It\u2019s always Broward County who can\u2019t seem to count votes. The panhandle is in a different time zone and polls are still open an hour after they close on the east coast. And 2 days later we still can\u2019t ever get the numbers from Broward. They do this chit every time\n@CNN Broward. It\u2019s always Broward. crooked A F!\n@TheBucket015 @CNNPolitics That chit is 2 years old. He settled that case and democrats claimed it as proof of his corruption right after the 2016 election. Look it up yourself. I\u2019m not your mama. And you can\u2019t live in my basement. #LazyAF. Dayum. Just ask Siri if you\u2019re to lazy to type a google search\n@RealJamesWoods Thankfully. I live in Florida and stand your ground includes my property. So I wouldn\u2019t have to wait until they are inside my house. I can shoot their asses on the front lawn.\n@Mirage495 @RealJamesWoods It\u2019s time to start making arrests. #EnoughIsEnough. It\u2019s only a matter of time until someone gets shot. @realDonaldTrump needs to take stand and restore law and order to the US.\n@xcynthiajackson @SJI2783 @CNN \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen\u201d. Wow. Utopia does not exist and just because news is unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean we should stick our heads in sand and act like \u201cit didn\u2019t happen\u201d. Moreover. You have the expanse of world information at your fingertips. Research anything you question.\n@MarvinSkipp @MSNBC How did she assault him by reaching for the mic? If that\u2019s the case, then I guess we have 34 other assaults because she passed that mic to literally every reporter who asked questions.\n@rthomas607 @MSNBC So you saw all of that but didn\u2019t see that she was passing the mic to literally every person who asked a question. \ud83d\ude01\n@TimArmstrong47 @MSNBC She wasn\u2019t ordered. It was her job to move the mic from person to person. Everyone else cooperated with her when she reached for the mic but Jim was just being Jim and didn\u2019t want to give the mic to anyone else. This suspension is long overdue.\n@MSNBC It wasn\u2019t \u201cdoctored\u201d, it was looped to show him pushing the interns arm away. This media is pathetic. You know damn good and well that YOU have video and therefore have no need to tweet something that implies that WH is the only one with video. You can easily check your video\n@TheBucket015 @CNNPolitics I\u2019m sure google would make it a number one result if you search for the Trump U lawsuit.\n@LipskerScott @CNN Red state for me. But I\u2019m with you brother. I wish we could all just go to our neutral corners and live in peace.\n@xcynthiajackson @CNN He was at work. His wife was home alone. She hid in the pantry and called 911 (fearing home invasion) and she was correct. They did hit the solid oak front door with enough force to crack the oak. It\u2019s time to start arresting these people before someone dies\n@CNN Yeah. It was a little more than shouting. They broke the front door. When will enough be enough. It\u2019s time to start prosecuting these people.\n@cnnadam @evanperez @PamelaBrownCNN @LauraAJarrett @SaraMurray Well I sure as hell hope that @CNN is right (for once).\n@LADivorceDiva @ScottPresler Chit. I admire the ole girl. She broke 3 ribs and didn\u2019t go to the hospital until the next day. That\u2019s hard core at 85 year old. All them O G\u2019s can kindly step aside now. Ruth Bader G is the G \ud83d\ude01\n@ScottPresler Ruth is strong as hell. This 85 year old woman fell &amp; broke 3 ribs but didn\u2019t go to the hospital until the next day. They made women (and men) a hell of a lot tougher back in the day.\n@TheBucket015 @CNNPolitics No. Actually I remember Trump paying something like 20 million to settle that lawsuit. FYI for future reference on your fake narratives. AG\u2019s prosecute crimes not file civil lawsuits.\n@CNNPolitics Pam Bondi sounds good\n@NBCPolitics @MSNBC @NBCNews Hmmm. I\u2019m a huge Trump supporter. But gotta say \u201caaaahhh, I dunno bout that\u201d\n@MSNBC So has 1/2 of America. You just don\u2019t like him because he isn\u2019t in the 1/2 that hasn\u2019t. But it\u2019s okay we\u2019re used to it. We know the wants to silence all voices who do not agree with them.\n@ValuesCommon @kenvogel @sllertzman @Acosta @WhiteHouse @PressSec Except that it was her job to pass the mic from one person to the other. So when the President said next question. She was reasonable to assume that Jim would cooperate in passing the mic to her like everyone else in the room did when it was time to let another reporter ask ?\u2019s\n@11thHour @MSNBC Good grief. This is not news. Hannity has been advocating this for at least a year. Why are you surprised that he would agree with the presidents decision? I actually stopped watching Hannity because I was SO tired of hearing \u201cwhere\u2019s Jeff Sessions\u201d\nAbout damn time https://t.co/84Q4UErWZC\n# hot damn ? https://t.co/RrkNU6bjfw\n@MSNBC Holy smokes. no.

Many were imprisoned, some are dead already like Turki Al-Jasser.\nhttps://t.co/8ddg9qv9Ni https://t.co/6BUbnKln5m\nExactly. Well, most of the shares have been bought by Saudi Arabia of Twitter, and always becomes active the moment Saudi Arabia does something regrettable. https://t.co/ErOudRwlVx https://t.co/1aiWwNLZEN\nThe interest in assassinations, covert operations and military campaigns like the war in Yemen was overseen by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. @sarahleah1 @abdu @CarolineLucas @KentThornhillMP @sahouraxo @georgegalloway @DanielWickham93\nGeorge Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, arranged the meeting. He had met previously with Saudi Prince MBS, and had pitched the Iran plan to Trump White House officials. Joel Zamel, an Israeli with deep ties to his country\u2019s intelligence was another participant. https://t.co/FdYaQSDEUX\nThe businessmen saw their Iran plan both as a lucrative source of income and as a way to cripple a country that they and the Saudis considered a profound threat.\n\nhttps://t.co/2WWVajCVs7 https://t.co/sHz0p7V6D8\nGeneral Assiri\u2019s top aides inquired about killing Qassim Suleimani in the meeting last year who is the leader of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps who is also an enemy of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/Dvs1Fl8LAw\nMaj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri of Saudi Arabia was at the meeting with various Businessmen in #Riyadh last year where the businessmen pitched a $2 billion plan to use private intelligence operatives to try to sabotage the Iranian economy.\n@WendySiegelman @tparsi https://t.co/Ra3VqoMDKe\nThread:\nThe planning to kill enemies of Saudi Kingdom started a year before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He was brutally killed and was a victim of Saudi's MBS plan to assassinate all the enemies of the Kingdom. @hiattf @rezaaslan @funder \n@elopezgross\nhttps://t.co/2WWVajCVs7\nAnd they are still investigating Saudis!!

Too bad it had to be at the cost of our friend's life. The atrocities committed by Saudis in #Yemen are too often ignored by main stream media.

Even Trump has recognized it. Where are necessary sanctions against Saudi Arabia? @georgegalloway https://t.co/PL1GwiGCmg\nDon't forget his relations with Saudi Arabia despite the world outrage over a respectable journalist death and his consistency in helping Saudi and UAE to bomb #Yemen which has caused largest Saudi made humanitarian crisis over there. @georgegalloway @TrueFactsStated https://t.co/JTlUvOtOt7\n#JusticeForjamal has begun. Waiting for the US President Trump's response now. @KarenAttiah\nBREAKING--Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center has asked Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal to cancel the lecture in Cambridge which he was scheduled to give amidst international outcry over #JamalKhashoggi's mysterious death at Saudi Consulate \ud83d\udc4f @KarenAttiah\nhttps://t.co/84qdGAJcRn https://t.co/tNbdB0mOMC\nThe death of #JamalKhashoggi has caused a stir in the international community as Saudi Arabia has been accused by Turkey of orchestrating the crime. Meanwhile, the investigation is run by Saud-Al Mojeb, whose track record is abysmal. @georgegalloway\n\nhttps://t.co/OZGRj6wCbW https://t.co/m7NbkHURVa\nThere is no difference between ISIS and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed \"Bon Saw\" Salman. Both are extremely affected by criticism and enjoy chopping off heads of innocent people. This time MBS went 1 step ahead of ISIS &amp; dismembered the body of #JamalKhashoggi https://t.co/DXJ6QkuPkB\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman description of the martyred journalist as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood depicts that MBS would go to any length to justify the murder of #JamalKhashoggi even if by lying and slandering accusations. #JusticeForJamal\nSaudi Crown Prince MbS had portrayed the slain journalist #JamalKhashoggi as a \"dangerous Islamist\" days after his disappearance in a phone call with US President Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner &amp; national security adviser John Bolton. @iyad_elbaghdadi\nhttps://t.co/u3sBOSHLWi https://t.co/W8dpToycay\nMeanwhile Saudi Arabia has sent Saud al-Mojeb the Saudi attorney general, their most trusted ally who in the past has sentenced @salman_alodah and Israa al-Ghomgham to death for the investigation into #Jamal_khashoggi mysterious murder by Saudi officials. https://t.co/L3HTQbjs9N\nSaudi Arabia has sent their most gruesome attorney general Saud al-Mojeb for the investigation of #JamalKhashoggi's death. His history of sentencing activists to death is known to many. How on earth this man is going to give justice to Jamal Khashoggi? \nhttps://t.co/xeFW81OwlE https://t.co/QUTlPM1057\nThat look on his face clearly tells the whole different story. There is no repent or regret of any kind. Saudis have sent their attorney general to do the investigation who in the past has given orders to behead #HumanRightActivists. #JusticeForJamal @oamaz7 https://t.co/DrQH906Taz\n@realDonaldTrump Say something about the culprits of Jamal Khashoggi's murder. The whole  world is condemning Saudi Arabia and you haven't put a firm stance  against them. #justiceforjamalkhashoggi\n#Trump defended the #Saudi monarchy as an \u201cincredible ally\u201d and kept open the possibility that Saudi Crown Prince #MBS didn't order Saudi agents to kill #JamalKhashoggi. @joshtpm https://t.co/LekWkhjrK5\nSurvival of the weakest is exercised in the tyrannical system of #Saudi Arabia where those with strong personalities are the first ones to die a brutal death like, Suleiman al-Doweesh who criticized the MbS and was tortured to death after detention. #MBSKilledPrisoners https://t.co/xr2GQFkpgO\nAnother news after #khashoggi, Murder of cleric Suleiman al-Doweesh, a critic of #Saudi Prince #MBS only shows the weaker side of the kingdom.

Steven #Mnuchin has given up the thought of attending the economic forum held by the kingdom \u2013 a decorative event, to bury a hideous crime.\nA prince is perhaps mend to protect its people. However, #MbS's ego is only satisfied with brutal killings. This includes the recent assassination of #JamalKhashoggi for which he is distributing #AnnualBonus in #KSA. @SenCoryGardner #\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0647_\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0648 https://t.co/lLeYTncHlK\nTrump had previously warned of \u201csevere punishment\u201d for the kingdom if it was found to be involved in Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.

No Socialism no Communism. That would be the time to take up arms against the government.\n@thehill My question is, why would you. wear that? I don't think he should of been fired, but to wear that, is just dumb.\n@MiamiHerald @DriscollAmy @NancyGBrinker @Brueben @PennySShaffer @ChenMed people want to $50  dollars a month for insurance, but when they go to the hospitals they want the latest in medicine. all that has a cost. give up your $1000 iPhone n Jordans n buy insurance\n@ABC bye bye\n@thehill you can indict a donkey.\n@NBCNews No dumb ass, you are being critized, because you can't do your job.\n@shoebrian80 @ABC Oh! and the judge put a hold on Flynns case. we may have to pay this guy $100 of millions in a suit against the government\n@shoebrian80 @ABC all of which the FBI could of done, if they thought it was worth the trouble. the only reason they got guilty please was to avoid spending money. one guy was sentence to communite service, no one in jail.\n@thehill bernie, the only reason your in congress is because the 50 people that live there are your family member\n@MartinDaubney @AnnCoulter According to liberals, men are rapist n child molesters.\n@CBSNews ???\n@thehill You Found! 60000 votes! Where are the Republican votes?\n@ceostroff @MiamiHerald How is it, that you only find 60000 ballots Democratic vote!\n@usatodaylife @USATODAY Get the f out\n@CNN a flowers girl, she'll get eaten up in the primaries\n@NBCLatino @kristinapuga get into govern mentioned there and change to corruption\n@ABC There cannot be any legislation to protect Mueller. Mueller needs to present what he has, so we can end this. Millions have been spent and so far nothing had come out of this.\n@realDonaldTrump @MiamiHerald Feds should take over, fire every single person there.\n@ABC @MiamiHerald @nytimes so you going to tell me they only found Democratic vote!\n@CNN get over it, everyone else did\n@realDonaldTrump that is a funny thing, so you going to tell me they only found 80,000 democratic votes?\n@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews No one cares about Russia. Mueller has been mliking the system for tye past 2 yrs. This is costing us a lot of money and not a single conclusion evidence has come out.\n@nytimes The subway is a money pit. But it's the government's fault. They have let unions control everything, you have people making $100,000 and all they do is sell tickets.\n@CBSNews Gun control won't help\n@NBCNews nooo, ballots are only counted when the votes are too close to call. it's about math. if a candidate needs, let say 1000 votes to over come their opponents, but there are only 500 mail in ballots, no need to count them, because even if those 500 voted for him he still won't win\n@gabegutierrez @NBCNews here is a new  idea, fill the Rio grand with alligators\n@USATODAY idiot\n@USATODAY Not to worry, this socalist will soon be rich\n@doug_hanks @MiamiHerald Miami is a very corrupt city, mainly due to its Latin population, in particular, Cubans which are highly corrupt\n@MiamiHerald execute him\n@dmartosko Mueller has to go\n@OutFrontCNN The Mueller investigation need to end. He and his buddy have milked the tax payers oUT of millions of dollars. we have nothing for it.\n@NBCNews people should just a bandon that state. we should just make the whole state of  California a national park, just visit n get out.\n@nytimes yes please.\n@nytimes Hu! gun laws didn't help did it.\n"}, {"article_url": "http://usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/12/ryanair-plane-impounded-over-unpaid-bill-149-passengers-aboard/1977681002/", "person_tweets": "UNC scores approval for $32M outpatient clinics https://t.co/93v2uD5y0m via @TriangleBIZJrnl\nTrading In Tokens: How Blockchain Technology Promises To Make Real Estate Affordable, Liquid For More Investors https://t.co/3gxyge25U2\nDuke Energy sells $1B worth of \u2018green bonds\u2019 https://t.co/iodJOcB0Kd via @TriangleBIZJrnl\n10 people followed me and 4 people unfollowed me // automatically checked by https://t.co/tZxGAvhZmi\nWildfires Kill at Least 5 Trapped in Cars in Northern California https://t.co/g4HQbN3bZH\nLindsey Graham in 2017: \u2018Holy hell to pay\u2019 if Sessions is fired.
