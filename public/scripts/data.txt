Still friends?\n@heretical_1 It seems like you\'re saying that 25A doesn\'t cover everything (agreed) and that, hypothetically, if all 17 positions mentioned in the line of succession were under indictment that _your best guess is_ Congress would consider appointing someone. Is that right?\n@DumbocratsSuck @ThisIsEarthB @GOP You keep repeating this and I keep pointing out that you, anonymous twitter troll, are not defeating anyone anywhere.\n@DumbocratsSuck @ThisIsEarthB @GOP If you feel abused by people pointing out that you\'re a liar then you should stop lying. Pretty simple. ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è\n@heretical_1 What do you mean by "punt?"\n@heretical_1 This seems more like conjecture than evidence that Congress is in constitutional position to appoint someone.

You\'re simply not smart and don\'t grasp facts and logic.\n@heretical_1 And my point is that, contrary to your claim, 25A does not have Congress appointing a president that I can see.\n\nConfirming and appointing are two very different things.\n@heretical_1 Correct that he was not elected and that he was confirmed by Congress.\n@heretical_1 @rebelroyalty20 Well we know nothing will happen until after Tuesday, that\'s part of it. Don\'t forget that they won\'t drop indictments starting 60 days prior to midterms, so it\'s possible that a ton will happen starting next week.\n@rebelroyalty20 @heretical_1 This is probably true but I still want an airtight case. I trust that Mueller knows what he\'s doing.\n@heretical_1 Agnew resigned. Nixon nominated Ford. Congress confirmed him. This is all per 25A.\n@heretical_1 No, I do not believe that his entire cabinet is guilty of RICO. I haven\'t seen evidence supporting that.\n\nFord was not appointed by Congress, he was VP.\n@heretical_1 @rebelroyalty20 I\'m frustrated with the timing as well, but it\'s still shorter than Watergate and I want his case to be airtight.\n@heretical_1 Yes, but he was VP when Nixon resigned. He wasn\'t appointed by Congress, that\'s a direct line of succession.\n@heretical_1 After Hatch they would have to indict his entire cabinet, Sessions, and other Secretary positions. I can\'t find anywhere that says Congress appoints anyone.\n\nNot trying to be argumentative at all, I respect you. Just want to make sure we\'re sharing facts is all.\n@heretical_1 What are the circumstances? Where is this covered in the Constitution?
